hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My god, you  for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
